    content: [
        `Dynamic routing is a powerful technique used in web 
        development to handle navigation and rendering of pages based 
        on changing parameters. Unlike traditional static routing, 
        where pages are created and rendered component by component,
         dynamic routing allows for more flexible and efficient handling of 
         complex app scenarios. In this article, we will explore dynamic routing
          using an example from an e-commerce app, demonstrating how it can be
           implemented in practice.`,

    title: 'Node.js8 Best practices for Express middlewares',
    content: [
        `Middleware functions are a fundamental 
        concept in web development, particularly in frameworks 
        like Express.js. They are small, reusable functions that 
        sit between the request and response cycle, allowing developers 
        to manipulate and transform the data in various ways. 
        Middleware functions can perform a wide range of tasks, 
        such as authentication, rate limiting, logging, and response
         modification. They are typically 
         used to decouple application logic from the main request handler,
          making the code more modular, flexible, and maintainable.
 Middleware functions are executed in a sequence,
  allowing developers to chain multiple functions together to create 
  a customized processing pipeline. Each middleware function has access
   to the request and response objects, as well as the next function in the chain, 
   enabling it to modify the data or pass control to the next function. 
   This architecture enables developers to build robust, scalable,
   and efficient web applications that can handle complex tasks with ease.`,

        `A majority of what we do in Developer 
        Advocacy is related to increasing awareness 
        of MongoDB within the community of developers 
        and data scientists. We do this through involvement 
        in a variety of user groups, industry conferences,
         and events as well as through management of the MongoDB Masters Program.
        This program was created to recognize leaders within 
        their community, experts in MongoDB, and professionals who 
        freely share their knowledge. 
        This year’s class includes returning Masters, as well as new members who have distinguished themselves in the past year.`,
